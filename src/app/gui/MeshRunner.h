// MeshRunner -- surface extraction from a trained model, driven from the GUI.
//
// Same public shape as SfmRunner / ColmapRunner (start / cancel / state /
// stage / error / drain_log), and for the same reason it runs as a CHILD
// PROCESS rather than in this one: the GUI already has a Vulkan device live
// (the viewer's), meshing wants its own multi-gigabyte VRAM budget for the
// per-camera renders, and every byte it held is gone when it exits. The child
// is this same executable (`spirula mesh`), so there is nothing to install.
//
// The stages come from the child's own `[meshing] <stage> (<secs>s)` lines,
// which both backends print, so the panel reports real progress rather than a
// spinner.
