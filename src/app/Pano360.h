// Pano360 -- a 360 camera's own frame layout, and the views a dataset wants
// out of it.
//
// One place owns the geometry: what a GoPro's two tracks hold, the plan that
// turns it into equirectangular or a ring of pinhole faces, and the resampler
// both decode paths apply. ffmpeg is asked only to decode and to cut the
// tracks up; its own `v360=eac` insets every face by 2 px, which puts a 4 px
// step across the seam between the two tracks. docs/datasets.md records where
// the layout numbers were measured.
